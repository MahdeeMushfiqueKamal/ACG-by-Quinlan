## Intro to R

#### Basic Motivation: 

Biology used to be a data poor discipline due to the cost to do experiments and technical difficulties, but now with Next Generation Sequencing, improvement in microscopy we have a lot of data now. 

In this data, there is 'True Biological Signal' but swimming in the sea of 'Technical Noise'. We need to ensure that our data is reproducible. This is coming from the Biological signal, not from Technical noise. 

That's why we need to know our data. In order to know our data, we need to visualize our data. 

#### Why R?
1. More comprehensive Statistical approach
2. Open Source, New Package
3. Reproducible Script.
