## Pattern Matching in Human genome. 

#### Class Notes: 

**FASTA Format**
- created by William Pearson.
- One of the worst but standard file format.
- Sort of like a big text file. 
- There is a header that contains the chromosome or gene information followed by a sequence. 

#### Working with a FASTA File. 

Though Experiment: We are designing a primer to PCR-amplify a particular. How to find other off-target loci? 

```bash
$ curl http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz > chr22.fa.gz
$ gzip -d chr22.fa.gz   # Decompressing
$ mv chr22.fa hg.b37.chr22.fa   # rename the file. 
$ grep ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa
```

Caution: Don't use > without putting quote mark. Otherwise fasta file will be replaced by nothing. 

```bash
dhrubo@Dhrubo-PC:~/Desktop/new-folder$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | wc -c
51834838
dhrubo@Dhrubo-PC:~/Desktop/new-folder$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | wc -l
1016370
```

Fist command shows number of characters in lines that doesn't contain ">". But this is not the number of nucliotides, because it contains \n characters. 

So, total number of nucliotides = 51834838 - 1016370 = 50818468

Finding total number of A in sequence.

```bash
$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | grep -c "A"
```
But this only gives us the number of lines with A in it. 

```bash
dhrubo@Dhrubo-PC:~/Desktop/new-folder$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | grep -o "A" | wc -l
4583339

$ # grep -o will extract every match and put it in a new line. 
```

This data is not perfect because we missed 'a'. 


#### Why lowercase and Uppercase both 'A' in fasta file?

45% of the gene is repetative. If the sequence is repetative then its lowercase. 


```bash
dhrubo@Dhrubo-PC:~/Desktop/new-folder$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | grep -o "[A|a]" | wc -l
10382214

$ # "[A|a]" is a regular expression which says A or a. 
```

#### More Regular Expressions to find what we are looking for.

```bash
$ grep -v ">" hg.b37.chr22.fa | grep --color "AATTC[CG]AA"   # match AATTCCAA or AATTCGAA
$ grep -o -P "gene_id \"\S+\"" genes.gtf    # match gene_id followed by any non-whitespace surrounded by quotes.
```

#### Sort and Uniq 

```bash

```
