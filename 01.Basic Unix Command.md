## Basic Unix Commands in the Course:

####   Directory Operations

```bash
$ ls 		# short form of list. This will show all the subdirectories in a directory.
$ ls -l		# Detailed list
$ ls ~ 		# show root directory
$ mkdir new-folder		# will create a new folder in the current directory
$ cd new-folder			# Will change the directory  
$ cd .. 	# Move back to predecessor directory. 
$ pwd		# Present Working Directory.	 
```

#### Creating or Downloading a file

```bash
$ touch data.txt	# This will create a new empty file called data.txt 
$ wget https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u1007787/genes.gtf  # The file will be downloaded from the link and added to the pwd
$ curl http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz > chr22.fa.gz # collect url,get the data save to chr22.fa.gz
```

####  Viewing a file. 

```bash
$ head data.txt		 # First 10 line of data.txt
$ head -15 data.txt  # First 15 line of data.txt
$ tail data.txt 	 # Last 10 lines of data.txt  

$ cat genes.gtf 	 # Will Display the whole file on terminal
$ cat -n genes.gtf 	 # Will display the whole documents will line count.
$ cat -E genes.gtf 	 # This will also show hidden characters line \n, \t
$ wc genes.gtf  	 # wc - word count 	Displays line word bytes
$ more genes.gtf 	 # displays content of the file that fits in the screen.
$ #press space for more content , q to quit to terminal
$ less genes.gtf     # do more than more. Displays file with up and down arrow feature.
$ less -S genes.gtf  # View document with lest and right scroll feature.
$ less genes.gtf \exon 		# Show lines with word "exon" in it. 
```

#### GREP - General Regular Expression Patterns. 

```bash
$ grep "exon" genes.gtf  # shows line with "exon" term in it
$ grep "exon" -w genes.gtf  # shows line with "exon" word in it
$ grep "exon" -v genes.gtf 	# shows lines that does not contain entry "exon"
$ grep --color "exon" genes.gtf 	# will color the term "exon"
```
Note: need to use \" to use quote in Regular Expression

#### Piping Unix commands together with "|"

```bash
$ grep "gene" genes.gtf | head 		# find the first 10 "gene" matches
$ grep "gene" genes.gtf | wc -l 	# how many total "gene" matches?
$ grep --color \"PTPN22\" genes.gtf | grep -w exon | wc -l  # number of exon records for PTPN22
```

#### Terminal Shortcuts 

1. Shortcut Commands:
```bash
$ clear 	# This command will clear the terminal / cls 
$ history   # Displays prev used commands.
  305  less genes.gtf
  306  clear
  307  less -S genes.gtf
  308  history
$ !307 		# Use the 307th previously used command from history
$ man less  # This will show the manual for less command
$ which less  # This will show the location of less.
```
2. `Tab` to auto-fill
3. `ctrl` + `c` to kill a command
4. `ctrl` + `r` to reverse search a command

#### Path and Other Environment Variables.

Only the programs that are inside the path directories will be executed anywhere from the terminal. Or else command not found error. 

```bash
$ echo $PATH  # echo is similar to cat, but for variable. This will show the value of PATH 
$ PATH=$PATH:/home/dhrubo/tools  #will add this location to path variable 
$ ECOLIFA=/home/dhrubo/Desktop/new-folder/ecoli.fasta   # Save a file path as environment variable
$ less $ECOLIFA  # using the variable to access the file path. Doesn't work if the terminal session is closed.
$ chmod a+x filename  # change mode - make a file executable
```
