## Genetic Variation in human population

#### Informations:
- 99% of any primate's DNA is also same
- Any two human genomes have 99.8% the same DNA.
- That means there is a difference in 1/620 bp to 1/750 bp.
- There are 100 millions known genetic variations in humans.

#### Types of Variation:
1. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs)
> atcgTca
>
> atcgAca
>
Here T is changed to A

2. Insertion Deletion Polymorphism (INDELs):

> atc--ca
>
> atcGAca
>

GA is inserted in the 2nd gene (also deleted from the first gene)  

3. Structural Variants (SVs): Large blocks of extra, missing or rearranged DNA. Usually mega base pairs long.

#### Variation Quantities:

 - A typical human genome is different from the reference genome on 4.1 million to 5 million sites.
 - 99.9% variations are SNPs and INDELs
 - 2100 to 2500 structural variants. (should be ~10,000)

#### Why do we care about Genetic Variation:
- Understand the relationship between Traits and Diseases phenotype. Usually it was done using Controlled vs Cases Experiments. But those experiments fails to explain the mechanism or why this gene is the responsible gene.

- Important for rare genetic diseases.
- Reconstruct Evolution through Genetic Variation. (Find the most recent ancestor.)

#### Difference between Mutation and Polymorphism

**Not all mutation become polymorphism, but all polymorphism were once a mutation**

It's not easy to identify the origin of a polymorphism. It might be from a single mutation in one organism or independent mutations in several organisms in hyper mutable regions.

#### De novo Mutation

de novo means out of nothing.

Paternal and Maternal genes are homologous. But there is a SNP in one germ cell and children have a variation. Thus de novo mutation occurs.

Frequency of DNMs:

```
fq = rate of human mutation x haploid genome size
   = 1.1e-8 per bp per generation x 3.1e9 bp = 30 - 40 per generation
   = 80 per diploid
```

But this uses an average mutation rate in the human genome.

- Mutation is more in Sperm than in eggs. Because sperms are replicated more
- Number of DNMs has a positive correlation with parental age at childbirth.
- With an increase in father's age at childbirth, the number of DNMs in children increases by 3.
- With an increase in mother's age at childbirth, number of DNMs in child increase by 0.4


#### Effect of Mutation

1. Beneficial mutation results Positive selection
2. Deleterious mutation results Negative selection
3. Neutral mutation results in Genetic Drift.(changes in the frequency of a gene variant due to randomness)

**Genetic Bottleneck**: From a mixed population a set of organisms with different genetic variation ratio migrates. Overtime, the ratio remains the same, Population diversity reduces greatly.
